# About EzTee

This is a simple web application I developed for a clothing ecommerce platform I made named "EzTee". The website's layout has been designed to fit both desktop, tablet, and mobile view using Bootstrap class/elements. It also implements Pinia for state management and Vue Router for site navigation. The site also contains multi-step forms with basic validations, a search query system (based on a simulated databased in Javascript), and a working shopping catalogue selection system.
